      <p>
        Tan Dun is a Chinese composer specializing in contemporary classical
        music. If you have watched the movie "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon",
        the theme song of the movie is composed by Tan Dun. Tan Dun worked in
        the rice fields in his youth, where he learned the musical traditions
        that inspired his work. In 1986, he moved to New York to study music at
        Columbia University, where he wrote his first opera. His eclectic style
        made him popular all over the world. Tan Dun has won many awards,
        including BAFTAs, Oscars, and Grammys.
